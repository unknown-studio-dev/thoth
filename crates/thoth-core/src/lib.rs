//! # thoth-core
//!
//! Public API, traits, and core types for **Thoth** — long-term memory for
//! coding agents.
//!
//! This crate is intentionally small: it defines the stable surface every
//! other crate in the workspace depends on (types, traits, errors) and
//! nothing more. The top-level [`CodeMemory`] façade lives in the
//! [`thoth`](https://docs.rs/thoth) umbrella crate, which wires the
//! individual stores + the retriever + the memory manager behind a single
//! entry point.
//!
//! See [`../../DESIGN.md`](../../../DESIGN.md) for the architecture document.
